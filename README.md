# Dating-app OcupidMyHeart

Dating application where users can easily registrate themselves via form that checks availability of their username live. It also checks 
whether the passwords match, and whether all fields are filled out correctly (email format, length of the username, are required fields
empty or filled in). Only logged in users can look for other users, and while they are there chat with one another. They can also filter
other users by gender or country from which they come from. While they type the name of the country in the input field suggestions are 
made live from the letter that the user is currently typing. Suggestions are only the countries where at least one user is living. User 
can also edit or delete their profile. Deleting of the profile is permanent so the user is warned before taking the final step.
